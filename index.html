    <h1>Welcome to my blog !</h1>

    <p>The purpose of this website is to explain my thought about software architecture (Domain Driven Design,
        Microservices, ...), development workflow and companies organizations.<br>
        These talks are mostly theoretical or at least reflect my personal experiment. I don't think that one's
        experiment is enough to say this is the only true way to do things.</p>

    <p>With that said, I would really like to discuss about these subjects with you.</p>

    <p><strong>I hope you'll enjoy your reading.</strong></p>
